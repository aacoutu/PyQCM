Included in the "scripts" folder is a set of Python code for running an acoustic transfer-matrix analysis of films measured using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM).  This analysis (in "Modeling_Film_Properties.py") makes use of a continuum mechanics model of shear wave propagation, where the film deposited on the QCM sensor can be modeled using an arbitrary number of layers in order to identify local gradients in viscoelastic properties or density.  See our study using this approach: "Analyzing QCM Data Using a New Transfer-Matrix Model: Long-Ranged Asymmetric Gradient in Shear Modulus Identified Across Immiscible Glassy-Rubbery Polymer Interface," Alexander A. Couturier, Justin C. Burton, Connie B. Roth, Macromolecules 2025, 58, 3520-3536 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.4c02847).  In this study, we use the code included here to determine a large gradient in shear modulus across a glassy/rubbery polymer interface of polystyrene (PS) and polybutadiene (PB).  Detailed information on the mathematical reasoning underlying the code can be found in our publication. 

The input data one needs to provide "Modeling_Film_Properties.py" are the shifts in resonance frequency and dissipation of the QCM sensor as a result of the deposition of the studied film.  Such data can be extracted from raw resonance traces using "Circuit_Analysis.py" (also included in the "scripts" folder), where the specific circuit equation used corresponds to our experimental setup.  This code analyzes a given set of QCM resonance traces at different harmonics and outputs the associated resonance frequency and dissipation data.  For the details of our circuit equation and how it corresponds to our experimental setup, see the publication: "Physically Intuitive Continuum Mechanics Model for QCM: â€‰Viscoelasticity of Rubbery Polymers at MHz Frequencies,"  Yannic J. Gagnon, Justin C. Burton, and Connie B. Roth, Journal of Polymer Science 2022, 60, 244-257 (https://doi.org/10.1002/pol.20210763).

lmfit library installation in command prompt: if using pip, run- "pip install lmfit" ; if using conda, run one of the lines found here- https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lmfit

This should be the only library installation needed. In case of issues with version dependence, or if a virtual environment is desired, below are instructions for a stable installation of libraries to a virtual environment.

Install Anaconda and run these lines in order from the Anaconda command prompt:


conda create --name QCM_analysis_env  
conda activate QCM_analysis_env

conda install python=3.8  
conda install spyder=5.5.1  
conda install numpy=1.24.3  
conda install matplotlib=3.7.2  
conda install pandas=2.0.3  
conda install tk=8.6.14  
conda install sympy=1.12  
conda install conda-forge::lmfit=1.2.2

<br>
Then run Spyder from the Anaconda command prompt while in the virtual environment.
